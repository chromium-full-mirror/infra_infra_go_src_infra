// Regarding the file name which ends with '_windows_mac', we CANNOT change it
// to either '_mac_windows' or '_darwin_windows' or '_windows_darwin' because go
// build constraints has a rule that uses (and only use the last part

// will result in that the file can only be built on one platform, instead of
